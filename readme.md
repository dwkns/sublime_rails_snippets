### Rails / ERB snippets
In some cases these overide the internal Rails snippets some are new snippets.

Why do this? Mainly to add my own shortcuts.

So `%` for `<%  %>` or `=` for `<%=  %>`

## Installing
To install use...
  $ cd "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/"
  $ git clone https://github.com/dwkns/sublime_rails_snippets.git Rails
